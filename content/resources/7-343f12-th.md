  caption: "Representation of complex systems as networks can be useful for visualizing\
    \ their underlying structure, identifying functional units, and informing new\
    \ hypotheses. The network diagram shown here represents a map of protein-protein\
    \ interactions in a yeast\_(_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_) cell (Image by Hawoong\
    \ Jeong, KAIST, Korea)."
